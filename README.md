## Motivation

Sometimes I've found myself doing the simplest setup for a particular framework/language, specially in the JavaScript world where these days you have tons of good libraries to help you out.

What do I look for? If we are talking about JavaScript, a testing framework that works smoothly, some linting help, a tool that not matter which OS, IDE or editor your are using you can stick with team conventions, a building mechanism.

Setting up all these things might take some time so why don't you prepare one and reuse it? If you are thinking ok but there are a lot of other boilerplate/templates out there. Yes, that's correct. Unfortunately most of them contains a fair amount of other stuff that I don't need. Those things that I don't need it also makes an application bigger and more complex.

The idea behing this starter app is that you only have the minimum to start developing an application with React and Redux, testing, linting, packaging and building included. There is not a backend dependency. There is not a database selected and there is not a single CSS framework/style applied. You're completely free.
